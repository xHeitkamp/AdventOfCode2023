# 🎄 AdventOfCode2023 🎄

These are my solutions in JavaScript of the Advent of Code in 2023. Have a wonderful christmas! 🎄🎄🎄

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## How to run my code?

To get my solutions, just run following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

If you want to run a single day. In this example I want to see the solutions of day 1:

```bash
npm run day1
```
